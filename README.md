#NOOKBNB
This website is a AirBnB clone that is inspired by animal crossing. This was a very exciting project for me because I was able to incorporate one of my favorite hobbies which is playing video games.

## Languages and Frameworks Used
-React
-Redux
-Flask
-Python
-SqlAlchemy
-CSS

Here is a Live link to my application [NookBnB](https://nook-bnb.herokuapp.com/)

#Features
1. Users are able to create an account and login successfully 
2. Logged in users are able to view all posted homes that are available for booking.
3. Users are able to list their own home on the site with full CRUD
4. Users are also able to leave reviews on any homes they would like. 
5. User's are only allowed to edit and delete their own review as well as posted home.

#Goals
I plan on implementing a booking functionality as well as a search bar in order to search by state. I also plan on fixing up the CSS for site to look fun but aswell very professional.
